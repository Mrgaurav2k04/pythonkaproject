**Fertilizer Consumption Analysis Project**

**Overview**

This project analyzes fertilizer consumption data at the district level in India, utilizing data from ICRISAT. The analysis includes trends over time, state-wise comparisons, and visualizations of Nitrogen, Phosphate, and Potash (NPK) usage.

**Features**

Visualizes total fertilizer consumption trends over the years.
Identifies top-performing states based on average fertilizer usage.
Displays the average NPK share through a pie chart.
Provides a heatmap of fertilizer usage by state and year.
Compares fertilizer consumption per hectare (NCA vs GCA).
Offers a correlation matrix of usage metrics.
Shows year-wise NPK fertilizer usage with a stacked area chart.

**Technologies** **Used**

Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Matplotlib: Plotting library.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.

**Installation**
