Fertilizer Consumption Analysis in India
The foundation of this analysis is a robust dataset sourced from the ICRISAT Data Repository (accessible at: [http://data.icrisat.org/dld/src/crops.html](http://data.icrisat.org/dld/src/crops.html)). This dataset is a treasure trove of district-level agricultural statistics, meticulously compiled to support research on semi-arid crop systems and agricultural development.
